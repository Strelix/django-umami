# Django Umami

Umami is an analytics tracking tool to help you track user activity. A basic way to use it is to include it in your frontend 
code as a HTML `<script></script>` tag.

But what if you need more event tracking, such as sign ups or purchases on the backend.
That's where **django umami** can be used! You can integrate umami within your django applications with a few lines of code.
